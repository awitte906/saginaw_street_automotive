 Saginaw Street Automotive

- A website for a local mechanic shop built using HTML, CSS & Bootstrap.

- This is my first paid project and with that, some of the challenges I faced were how to speak with the customer to really understand what they were looking for and overcoming design differences with the customer. We worked together to achieve the final product and I love the final result. I also struggled a bit with learning and implementing search engine optimization as I was previously unfamiliar with it. 

- I loved this project. It really was a great learning experience for me; both technically speaking and in terms of speaking with and working alongside the customer.
